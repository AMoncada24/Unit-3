Do Now 3.01
#################
1.  In your Console
Type the following code:
    1   import random
    2   random.randint(0, 3)
    3   random.randint(0, 3)
    3   print(random.randint(0, 3))
    4   print(random.randint(0, 3))
    5   print(random.randint(0, 3))
2.  In your Notebook
Respond to the following
    1.  What does randint() do? Randomizes the choice between two variables and prints it.

    2.  What do the values 0 and 3 do? Try changing those numbers, rerun the program, and write down what changed. 0 and 3 set the upper and lower bounds of what integers the program can print.

    3.  What is the difference between random.randint(0,3) and print(random.randint(0,3))? There seems to be no noticeable change as the former already prints out the statement.
